# This Python script automates the process of booking appointments on a healthcare website designed for practicing automation using Selenium WebDriver. The project is structured with a main file and additional files containing functionality, including constants and initialization. For security reasons, the local path to WebDriver is hidden.

Key Features:

    Import Appointment Class: The script imports the Appointment class from the functionality-containing module, encapsulating the automation functionalities.

    Appointment Booking Process: It initiates the appointment booking process by creating an instance of the Appointment class and sequentially calling its methods:
        land_first_page(): Navigates to the initial landing page of the healthcare website.
        make_appointment(): Locates and clicks the appointment booking button.
        login(): Automates the login process using hardcoded credentials.
        select_facility(): Selects the desired healthcare facility and payment method.
        select_date(date): Chooses the appointment date from the calendar and provides additional information like comments.

    Sleep: The script includes a time.sleep(3000) call, pausing execution for 3000 seconds (50 minutes) to allow users to observe the booking process or perform any necessary manual actions.

Usage:
Users can run this script to practice automating the appointment booking process on the healthcare website designed for automation practice. Adjustments may be needed for specific website structures and element IDs.

Note:

    Users should ensure that Selenium WebDriver and necessary drivers are properly installed and configured.
    For security reasons, the local path to WebDriver is hidden in the script.
    Hardcoded credentials should be handled securely, potentially using environment variables or external configuration files.
